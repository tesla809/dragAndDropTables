Notes on the project.
This should be a readme.md, but just in case your computer doesnâ€™t
recognize the .md extension, I am using a .txt extension.
The actual js source code is in the directory src/js/es6/app.js
The css is compiled from LESS. Its directory is src/less/source.less

The open-me folder is just an easy drag and drop way to see the project
without having to install Grunt or the Grunt CLI.
